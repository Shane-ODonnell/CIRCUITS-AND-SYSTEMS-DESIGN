/*
TODO LIST
  Now I have a player and bot showing on the screen. the player can easily move up and down within the bounds of the screen, and there is a line down the middlle for set dressing.

  I currently have no notes for what needs improving on this project!!!
  
  Added new feature: when spawned the ball will move in the same direction that the player last moved in

  my screen seems to be fully dead pixels at the bottom and fully yellow at the top.
  the code at the moment is a bit of a mess which isnt helping either.

  /* 
    the player was moving to fast to be anyway controlled with precison. 
    I couldnt make vy a fraction because theres no moving half pixels
    the velocity is measured in pixels per frame
    so if I cant make it travel 0.5 pixels every frame
    I made it travel 1 pixel but only every second frame 
    I can have my slower player (0,5 pixel/frame = 1 pixel/ 2 frames) !!!


    ALSO by making the bot slower than the ball it makes for a bot that can actually be beaten!
